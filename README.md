Emergent Entity Chatbot





Information about the Archieved File.

Conclusion for the archived working chatbot file.

This archived version focuses on rule-based interactions rather than  
Neural Networks (NNs) or Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs).  

This approach enables the ChatBot to learn incrementally,  
adapt to new topics, and provide context-aware responses  
without relying on massive datasets or complex training processes.  

It demonstrates that emergent behavior can arise from  
rule-based systems just as effectively as from more complex  
models like NNs or SNNs.
