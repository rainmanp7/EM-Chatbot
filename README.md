Emergent Entity Chatbot

Conclusion for the archived working chatbot file.
The emergent behavior in this ChatBot comes from simple, rule-based interactions rather than Neural Networks or Spiking Neural Networks. This approach allows the ChatBot to learn incrementally, adapt to new topics, and provide context-aware responses without the need for massive datasets or complex training processes. It demonstrates that emergent behavior can arise from rule-based systems just as effectively as from more complex models like NNs or SNNs.
